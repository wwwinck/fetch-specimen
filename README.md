## About The Project

It's been a long time since I've posted anything on Github, and to remedy this, nothing better than a series of proofs of concept to get a fresh start.

This very simple project has only one function that retrieves data from an API.

But the most attentive will notice a small change when the window shrinks. Nothing incredible, but nice.
